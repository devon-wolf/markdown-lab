# markdown-lab

## Today we're going to do a little markdown

Reasons for writing markdown:
- quick way to prettify documentation
- fairly versatile from what I've seen so far, unlike some other formatted text types
- I like it!

```js
console.log('Don\'t you know any other things to do in JavaScript?');
```

### That's all for now, see y'all later.
