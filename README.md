# markdown-lab

## Today we're going to do a little markdown

**Reasons for writing markdown**:
- quick way to prettify documentation
- fairly versatile from what I've seen so far, unlike some other formatted text types
- I like it!

```js
console.log(`Don't you know any other things to do in JavaScript?`);
```

_I've put some text here in italics as well._

And I've gone to the table-making-wizards and have acquired a table:
| **Submission Type** | *Finish percentage* | *Average difficulty*                       |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Chokes              | Idk, high?          | Pretty easy, if you can get there          |
| Joint Locks         | Probably lower      | Finicky and varied                         |
| Slicers             | Probably even lower | I don't really know, I do them by accident |


### That's all for now, see y'all later.
